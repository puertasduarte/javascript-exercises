/*
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid,
using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the
grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should
form a chessboard. Passing this string to console.log should show
something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a
binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size,
outputting a grid of the given width and height.
